Objective: Phone App

Description:

In the project, three folders will be found:
1)PhoneCatalog
2)OrderExecution
3)Execution

1)PhoneCatalog
Creates a Rest API to retrieve a phone catalog.
Currently the catalog is created as a spring.datasource.url. This extract the database catalog from the file src/main/resources/data.sql.
Once executed, use curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/phones to check the catalog.

2)OrderExecution
Receive an order, retrieve the phone catalog and generate a JSON file with the order information adding the total price of the order.
Replace the order_path in config.properties.

3)Execution
Execute the whole application: load the catalog and process the order.
It uses the JARs from PhoneCatalog and OrderExecution.
Replace the order_path, order_jar and phone_jar in config.properties.
Execute the bash script run_to.sh. This script will generate a log and a JSON file called orderList with the order information.


Future Implementations:
1) Dockerizing the app for an easier execution.
2) Externalize the test database so it can be loaded from any external .sql file.
